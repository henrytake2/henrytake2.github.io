                <h1>An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS.</h1>
                <p>If you were to build a car you would use HTML
                    <br>
                    Now when you want to make the car look good interior exterior paint job you would use CSS
                    <br>
                    JavaScript would represents the engine for e.g whenever i want to go forward i would step on the pedal and if i want to turn left i would
                    use the indicators and the left lights would turn on
                </p>

                <h1>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life.</h1>
                <p>Control flow is when the computer runs code from top all the way to the bottom unless it
                    comes across conditionals or loops which change the control flow. Its like when your reading a book but your thinking of what your gonna eat for dinner then realise
                    that you forgot where you at on the page so you have to start again
                </p>

                <h1>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.</h1>
                <p> The Document Object Model (DOM) is an application programming
                    interface (API). Its like a master key of web design. The dom can be
                    used to manupilate a web pages design in any way you like.</p>
                
                <h1>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h1>
                <p>An array is a way of arranging things in rows and columns. If you were to buy things like an [Apple, Watermelon, 
                    or potatoes], the items are lined up to create an array and you can access it by using numerical index. You have to start counting from 0 when your trying
                    to access the items in the array for e.g if you want to access Watermelon you would code [1] 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Objects is a container in JavaScript which contain properties and can store a collection of data. Its sorted of like an array
                </p>
                
                <h1>Explain what functions are and why they are helpful.</h1>
                <p>Functions are code that perform a specific job. Functions take in information
                    (arguements), process it, and "return" a result. a function can be
                    used (called) over and over and over again to perform the task that is
                    assigned to it</p>
