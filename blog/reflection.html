                <h1>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h1>
                <p>
                    I learnt that i can get upset easily when things are not working. I need to remind myself that its not supposed to be easy. And its a good thing
                    that its challenging because thats how we learn and grow.
                    <br>
                    I learnt that having a fixed mindset can stop you from acheiving your goals.
                    <br>
                    Being more aware of myself when reflecting after each sprint. 

                </p>

                <h1>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h1>
                <p>
                    They are a key components for you being able to learn, listen, connect and communicate effectively. Without these values it hard 
                    to build a strong relationship with others
                </p>

                <h1>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h1>
                <p>
                    I think learning about mindfullness has suprised me. At first i thought it was useless. But the more i practiced it the more i saw the benifits from it.
                    it really helped reset myself whenever i got overwhemled. 
                </p>

                <h1>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h1>

                <p>
                    Finding someone to pair up with for listening and looping. I find it hard to put myself out there but i got there eventually. 
                    Sometimes i find doing reflections boring.
                </p>

                <h1>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h1>

                <p>
                    Core skills are a important tool it helps you communicate clearly with others. 
                    And you can connect with others and work easily as a team. No one likes a shit teammate.
                </p>

                <h1>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h1>

                <p>
                    Nope. I understand that its important to work together as a team. I think being an average programmer that works well in a team is better than 
                    a good programmer thats a dickhead.
