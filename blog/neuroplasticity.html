                <h1>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make.
                    The decision you made and the consequences of the action you took</h1>
                <p>I was serving time in jail when I came across a course called Take2. They teach prisoners how to code. Before joining this course I didn't know where I was heading in life.
                    I thought I was going to go back to doing what I was doing before going to prison once released. But not long after joining Take2, I realized that this was something that I enjoyed
                    doing and saw that it was an opportunity for me to do something good with my life. So coding has changed my life.
