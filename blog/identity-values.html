            <h1>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make.
                The decision you made and the consequences of the action you took</h1>
            <p>I was serving time in jail when i came across a course called Take2. They teach prisoners how to code. Before joining this course i didn't know where i was heading in life.
                I thought i was going to go back doing what i was doing before going to prison once released. But not long after joining Take2 i realised that this was something that i enjoy
                doing and saw that it was an opportunity for me to do something good with my life. So coding has changed my life. 
            </p>
    
            <h1>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity</h1>
            <p>Im from Tahiti and Cook islands. My life experiences being a Pacific islander has taught me to be respectful to others, be humble, 
                caring and giving and being family orientated.</p>
    
            <h1>Describe your strengths and limitations.</h1>
            <p>My strengths are that i am determined, resilient compassionate. I also learned about having a growth mindset
                beleiving that my basic abilities can be developed through hardwork and dedication. That is something that i have struggled with for a while now.
                beleiving that im not good enough or smart enough to do something. So developing a growth mindset has help me.
