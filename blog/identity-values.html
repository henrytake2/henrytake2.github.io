                <h1>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make.
                    The decision you made and the consequences of the action you took</h1>
                <p>I was serving time in jail when I came across a course called Take2. They teach prisoners how to code. Before joining this course I didn't know where I was heading in life.
                    I thought I was going to go back to doing what I was doing before going to prison once released. But not long after joining Take2, I realized that this was something that I enjoyed
                    doing and saw that it was an opportunity for me to do something good with my life. So coding has changed my life. 
                </p>
        
                <h1>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity</h1>
                <p>Im from Tahiti and Cook Islands. My life experiences being a Pacific islander taught me to be respectful to others, humble, 
                    caring, giving, and family orientated.</p>
        
                <h1>Describe your strengths and limitations.</h1>
                <p>My strengths are that I am determined, resilient compassionate. I also learned about having a growth mindset
                    believing that my basic abilities can be developed through hard work and dedication. That is something that I have struggled with for a while now.
                    believing that I'm not good enough or smart enough to do something. So developing a growth mindset has helped me.
                </p>
        
                <h1>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension.</h1>
                <p>There was a time when a few of my mates wanted me to be their trainer because they wanted to get fit and lose abit of weight. So i took them through
                    a typical training session that i did which consisted of burpees and bear crawls. Not long after that they didn't want to train with me anymore hahaha.
                </p>

                <h1>Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they
                    were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why</h1>
                <p>I realised that we were all on different fitness levels and i pushed them too hard too soon. So the next session i had to take it easy on them so they
                    can slowy work up to it. Now they love doing burpees.
