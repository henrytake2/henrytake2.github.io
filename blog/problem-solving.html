                <h1>What was the problem?</h1>
                <p>
                    I got stuck on Manipulating JS Objects. This is a challenge that requires you to manipulate things in the object.
                    I had a go at it but i wasnt getting it to turn True. Whenever i get stuck on something i always try to do it myself before asking for help.
                    so i went back to sprint 3 intro to Js and watched the Objects video again and that helped me on how to approach this challenge.
                    I realised that it was pretty simple i just needed to spell it correctly because its case sensitive.

                    <br>
                    As i got towards the end of the challenge, my anxiety levels started to come down. What i took away from this challenge is to relax and take my time to check the spelling of the syntax.

                    <span>Pseudocode:</span> I use this method when im laying out my webpage. It makes it easier for people who are reaing my code understand whats going on.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <span>Trying something</span> I usually try to figure it out on my own. If i dont know what to do i look in the discord then if i cant find anything on there

                    <span>Console.logging</span> I been using it abit more this sprint and i understand that its really useful.

                    <span>Asking coaches for help</span> i haven't been doing this as much as i like. i have been using the discord or my cohort for help.
